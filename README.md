# Neural Networks: Fundamentals and Applications

This project outlines the primary features of Neural Networks (NNs) and their main applications, highlighting recent advances in the field. The central focus of this work is **Reservoir Computing**, with a specific emphasis on its implementation using spintronic devices. Finally, a **skyrmion-based neural network** architecture is demonstrated for reservoir computing tasks.

The theoretical framework and implementation details are based on the following references:
